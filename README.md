# Arthur Carl Forest-Jones

As a recent graduate from Makers Academy I have become fully immersed in the world of technology.

Through Makers, I have had the opportunity to learn a number of languages, technologies and frameworks working through a number of projects implementing various workflow processes. I am continuing to grow and develop my knowledge through personal projects, study and meetups.

I am very creative and have a strong background in design where I developed an extensive knowledge of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Having worked in the fitness industry for a number of years I enjoy keeping a good level of health, which helps me to stay energetic and focused.

I am on the hunt for a full-time developer role, in a company where I can keep growing and developing my skills. I wish to be an integral member of a team, working on challenging projects doing work that excites me and I can be proud of.

## Skills

#### Growth

I am always eager to keep growing and learning. I enjoy the challenge of constantly learning new skills and developing my knowledge to further my career. Throughout my fitness career I did a number of courses which lasted between 2 days and a year, to help better my craft. When I was focused on design I went on numerous life drawing, painting and drawing courses and did internships to better understand the field I wanted to build my business in.

#### Motivation/Attitude

#### Communication

Throughout my career, one of my most useful skills has been my ability to communicate with people. I have an affable and empathetic nature, which has meant I have had great success in both client facing and team based roles. I have developed and honed this skill in every role I have had from building bussiness as a recruiter and personal trainer, to working in a team on projects at Makers Academy.
