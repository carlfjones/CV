# Arthur Carl Forest-Jones

As a recent graduate from Makers Academy I have become fully immersed in the world of technology.

Through Makers, I have had the opportunity to learn a number of languages, technologies and frameworks working through a number of projects implementing various workflow processes. I am continuing to grow and develop my knowledge through personal projects, study and meetups.

I am very creative and have a strong background in design where I developed an extensive knowledge of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Having worked in the fitness industry for a number of years I enjoy keeping a good level of health, which helps me to stay energetic and focused.

I am on the hunt for a full-time developer role, in a company where I can keep growing and developing my skills. I wish to be an integral member of a team, working on challenging projects doing work that excites me and I can be proud of.

## Skills

#### Communication and Teamwork

Throughout my career, one of my most useful skills has been my ability to communicate with people. I have an affable and empathetic nature, which has meant I have had great success in both client facing and team based roles. I have developed and honed this skill in every role I have had from building bussiness as a recruiter and personal trainer, to running a team as a manager and most recenlty working in a successful teams on projects at Makers Academy.

#### Creativity and Innovation

I am a creative person, which helps me to both understand and deal with clients and creative problem solving and also thinking outside the box when solving logic problems. I have a strong history in design from my University education and freelance graphic and fashion design work, in addition to this I started my own business in fashion industry (This project is on hiatus, while I begin my career in development - suspended not forgotten!).

#### Motivation/Attitude

My motivation and attitude in the workplace is one of the reasons I have always excelled. I maintain the believe that positivity, communication and hard work are all imperative for a workplace to be at is most productive and enjoyable for all involved. Beacuse of this, In my two most recent places of work, I was fortunate enough to be promoted over more experienced colleagues. At University I was voted in as Student President and put in charge of a team to be the voice of the students, organise events and ensure a high level of student satisfaction.

#### Growth and ability to learn

I have always been and continue to be eager to keep growing and learning. I enjoy the challenge of constantly learning new skills and developing my knowledge to further my career. Throughout my fitness career I completed a number of courses, some of which were a year long, in order to better my craft. When I was focused on design I went on numerous life drawing, painting and drawing courses and enrolled in internships to better understand the industry. Of course, most recently I have dedicated my time to learning how to code at Makers, in my final two week project I managed to teach myself how to use a game engine and a new language. I am looking to continue to learn and push myself both in the workplace and on personal projects.
