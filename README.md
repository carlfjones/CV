# Arthur Carl Forest-Jones

As a recent graduate from Makers Academy I have become fully immersed in the world of technology.

Through Makers, I have had the opportunity to learn a number of languages, technologies and frameworks working through a number of projects implementing various workflow processes. I am continuing to grow and develop my knowledge through personal projects, study and meetups.

Currently I have a good understanding of the languages Ruby, Rails, Javascript, C#, the game engine Unity, SQL/Postgres, CI/CD, processes including Agile, TDD and pair programming.

I am very creative and have a strong background in design where I developed an expert knowledge in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.

I am on the hunt for a full-time developer role, in a company where I can keep growing and developing my skills. I wish to be an integral member of a team, working on challenging projects doing work that excites me and I can be proud of.
